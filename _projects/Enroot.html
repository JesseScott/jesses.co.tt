			<strong>Enroot</strong> is an iOS & Android application that I am involved in devloping for
			<a href="http://www.enrootmeals.com/" target="_blank">Enroot Meals Ltd</a>.
			I have been primarily responsible for the Android application, but have consulted heavily on the iOS client,
			as well as having been partially responsible for the backend and UI/UX design.
			<br><br>
			The Enroot service is a delivery-anywhere commissary kitchen, where your smartphone acts as a menu and payment service,
			allowing you to quckly order food to your exact GPS location.
			As part of this, I had to handle Geolocation, user management, database access, cryptography, and financial transactions in the development.
			<br><br>
			The application is currently undergoing Beta testing, and will be available on the App Store's soon.
			<br><br>
			Source code is not available, as this is a client project.
