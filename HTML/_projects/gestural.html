				<strong>gestural</strong> was a software work that I presented during a commission from VIVO Media Arts,
				where I was invited to create work for a POV (persistence of vision) machine built by Brady Marks,
				that allowed for 3D content to be displayed upon a rapidly spinning grid of LEDs.
				<br><br>
				My impulse was to explore the way that the audience could conceivably interact with the visual installation from
				any and all angles.
				<br>
				The unique propostion of the POV system is that it is viewable 'in the round', so I designed a set of experiences that would
				encourage the audience to become embodied in the space while giving them a large degree of agency over the visual information.
				<br>
				My hope was that they would steadiy demistify the technology by gaining cognizance to it's workings, and transcend to a more
				experiential realm, which I felt the installation thrived upon.
				<br><br>
				I ended up crafting three articulate compositions:
				<br>
					* an audio reactive equalizer that responded to sonic interaction in realtime
				<br>
					* a 'Natzke Ribbob' - a simulation of flowing cloth in 3D space, controlled by an Android tablet
				<br>
					* an interactive cube that could change shape and scale, controlled by an Android tablet
				<br><br>
				I wrote custom software for the Android tablet to respond to and send gestures to a host computer, running Processing,
				that interfaced with the BeagleBone computer driving the POV.
				<br>
				The source code is available on my GitHub.
				<br><br>
				After the initial commission, VIVO gained additional funding from Telus to provide a week-long workshop for Youth to learn how to
				program for the POV hardware.
				<br>
				I was invited to co-design and co-teach this workshop along with Brady Marks.
				We ended up working with 6 teens to create 6 unique pieces for the installation.
