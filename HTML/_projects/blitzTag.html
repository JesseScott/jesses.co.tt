						blitzTag is a software application written as part of my involvement with <a href="http://www.graffitiresearchlab.de"  target="_blank">Graffiti Research Lab Germany</a>.
						<a href="https://"  target="_blank">Achim Kern</a> was the lead programmer on the project, and I undertook an assistant role in the development.
						<br><br>

						The project aims to be a successor to the original <a href="https://"  target="_blank">L.A.S.E.R. Tag</a> project written by the members of the original GRL Chapter in NYC.
						<br><br>

						The program allows users to track a laser pointer - or any other sufficiently bright light source - with a camera,
						and feeds the XY coordinates of the laser to the software in realtime, whereupon it renders the point like a pen stroke,
						according to various visual parameters the user has set, so that it feels like you are drawing on a surface in realtime.
						It is often used in accordance with LARGE walls and BRIGHT projectors, with canvases upwards of 75 feet in diameter,
						so that it becomes a very public and political event.
						<br><br>

						The software was written in <a href="http://www.derivative.ca/"  target="_blank">Touch Designer</a>,
						a graphical programming environment made for realtime graphical control,
						and which has been expanded into a comprehensive toolkit for digital artists.
						<br>
						<br>
						The project page can be seen at
						<a href="http://graffitiresearchlab.de/blitztag"  target="_blank">GRLG / Blitz Tag</a> and the source code can be found
						on the <a href="https://github.com/GraffitiResearchLabGermany"  target="_blank">GRLG GitHub</a>.
