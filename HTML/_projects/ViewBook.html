					<p>
						ECUAD ViewBook is an iOS application made for <a href="http://www.ecuad.ca/">Emily Carr University of Art + Design</a>.
						<br>
						<br>
						The 'ViewBook' has traditionally been a print-based student recruitment tool, and ECUAD was eager to push the content into the mobile sphere.
						<br>
						<br>
						This project was challenging, in the amount of research and dialogue that went on with the client in attempting
						to translate a book-based experience into the context of mobile.
						<br>
						<br>
						The application was coded in Objective-C against the iOS 6.1 SDK, and was made with the support of <a href="http://hodgkinsondesign.com/about">Carley Hodgkinson</a>,
						the (then) Senior Communication Designer at Emily Carr, as well as Rongxin Zhang and <a href="http://troykasting.com/">Troy Kasting</a>,
						two of my students in the ECUAD Interaction Design Essentials program.
						<br>
						<br>
						The application (requires iOS 6 or greater) can be downloaded from
						<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/emily-carr-viewbook/id698402360?mt=8">iTunes</a> and the source code can be found
						on my <a href="https://github.com/JesseScott/ViewBook">GitHub</a>.
