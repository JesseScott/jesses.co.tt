				PWN THE WALL was a 25 hour interactive digital graffiti event connecting Vancouver, Berlin, and Seoul.
				<br><br>
				Created by GRL members in Canada, Germany, and South Korea, PWN THE WALL uses open-source technology to collapse geographical space through a real-time telematic exchange.
				<br>
				Simultaneous live digital painting events in all three cities showcased local graffiti writers.
				<br>
				The installation was interactive and open to the public for the duration of  PWN THE WALL.
				<br><br>

				PWN THE WALL continued our collaboration with German colleagues at GRL Germany.
				<br>
				After working together to create ‘Light Rider’ (mobile projection bike) and Original G-Code (live drawing to 3-D fabrication system), our collectively-run groups developed the technology to produce digital graffiti that was live-streamed and re-projected, collapsing geographical space through a series of public events and ongoing interactive installations.
				<br>
				GRL Canada Members include Jesse Scott & Mirae Rosner with Semiramis Ceylan, Hauke Altmann and Achim Kern comprising the main team at GRL Germany.
				<br><br>

				The final installation took the form of a networked 3-Channel video installation, with one interactive screen for each city, and two screens that represent real time updates from the interactive screens in the other two cities.
				<br>
				During certain times, commissioned graffiti writers created custom pieces on the interactive wall, and these pieces were also projected on a much larger surface, drawing remote graffiti on the local, urban fabric.
				<br><br>

				We coded and produced and distributing this project exclusively through open-source tools and technologies.
				<br>
				PWN THE WALL furthers our ongoing commitment to urban interventions that take graffiti into the digital age through open approaches to community and technology.
