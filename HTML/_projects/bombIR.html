				<strong>bombIR</strong> is a software application written as part of my involvement with both
				<a href="http://www.graffitiresearchlab.de" target="_blank">Graffiti Research Lab Germany</a>,
				and
				<a href="http://www.graffitiresearchlab.ca" target="_blank">Graffiti Research Lab Canada</a>.
				<br><br>
				The project was first conceived of in the early days of GRL Canada, after extensive consultations with graffiti writers.
				<br><br>
				The program allows users to track an infrared LED - engineered into the cap of a modified spray paint can - with a camera,
				and feeds the XY coordinates of the LED to the software in realtime, whereupon it renders the point like a pen stroke,
				according to various visual parameters the user has set.
				Used in concurrence with a rear projection screen, it feels like you are drawing on a surface in realtime.
				<br>
				It is often used in accordance with LARGE walls and BRIGHT projectors, with canvases upwards of 75 feet in diameter,
				so that it becomes a very public and political event.
				<br><br>
				The software was written in
				<a href="http://www.processing.org/" target="_blank">Processing</a>,
				a creative coding environment environment made for realtime graphical control,
				and which has been expanded into a comprehensive toolkit for digital artists.
				<br>
				<br>
				The project page can be seen at
				<a href="http://graffitiresearchlab.de/mombir" target="_blank">GRLG / bombIR</a>
				and the source code can be found on the
				<a href="https://github.com/GraffitiResearchLabGermany" target="_blank">GRLG GitHub</a>.
