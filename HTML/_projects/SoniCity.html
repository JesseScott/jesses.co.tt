			SoniCity
		</H1>
		
		<H4>
			<p> 
				SoniCity is an abstraction of various people's movements through space - an abstraction through sound. 
				<br>
				It traces pathways and velocities and transforms the data into sonic reverberations. 
				<br>
				The result is a map that unfolds through time - a that map reflects the complexity of human travel as experienced through flow.
				<br>
				<br>
				SoniCity revolves around recording GPS tracks: data is brought into a Pure Data patch, parsed, then the individual GPS attributes 
				<br>
				(i.e. Latitude, Longitude) are used to drive the sonic engine.  
				<br>
				<br>
				SoniCity allows us to think about public space and mobility in novel ways, creating a playful relationship to our journeys and their audible results. 
				<br>
				We are not attempting to produce an objective cartography.
				By drawing awareness to our patterns, 
				<br>
				it becomes possible to imagine alternatives â€“ in shared spaces and in sound.
				<br>
				In this way, SoniCity becomes a tool for the derive - i.e. psycho-geographical exploration, and makes public space an instrument with which to play. 
				
				<br>
				<br>
				The project was conceived and started back in 2008 at the <strong>Almost Perfect</strong> locative media residency at the Banff New Media Institute, 
				<br>
				and was supported technically at that point by <strong>Brady Marks</strong> and <strong>Kenny Lozowski</strong>.
				<br>
				Around 2010, the project was assumed as a project with my collective <strong>the memelab</strong> and went under a vast ideation process with my
				<br>
				partner <strong>Mirae Rosner</strong>, whose experience in Urban Geography and Somatic Movement practice brought a great deal of theoretical investigation to the project.
				<br>
				In 2012, the project was shown at the <strong>Nida Art Colony</strong> in Nida, Lithuania, and at the <strong>Tracing Mobilities</strong> exhibition at the Haus der Kulturen der Welt in Berlin.
				<br>
				In 2013, I was offered an Artist Residency at <strong>DAIMON</strong> in Gatineau, Quebec, and further developed the programmatic elements of the the piece.
				<br>
				<br>
				More (historical) information for the project can be seen on <a href="http://www.memelab.ca/sonicity/">the memelab site</a>, 
				<br>
				as well as a blog post <a href="http://blog.jesses.co.tt/post/55453823593/sonicity-artist-residency-at-daimon">here</a>, and the source code for the project is available on my
