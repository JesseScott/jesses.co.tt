			<p>
				Since 2012, I have been teaching Interaction Design and Smartphone Programming at Langara College and Emily Carr University of Art + Design, where I recently became the Program Director for the Interaction Design Essentials Certificate. <br><br>
				From 2010-2012, I travelled extensively throughout Europe creating interactive software work for residencies, festivals, and exhibitions. <br><br>
				For the bulk of 2009 and 2010, I worked at Rockheim, the Norwegian Museum of Rock and Roll, where I was responsible for designing, installing, and programming the a/v, interactive, and network components; I staged & calibrated multi-channel audio and video setups, interactive and audience-controlled mechanisms, and did software programming for 11 exhibits. <br><br>
				Since 2007, I have been a member of Graffiti Research Lab, having produced several large scale outdoor urban projections in Vancouver, Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal, Berlin, and Madrid, with projection rigs ranging up to 22K Lumens. <br><br>
				From 2003 to 2006, I was the Technical Director for New Forms Festival in Vancouver, and produced 50+ concerts, galas, site-specific performances, conferences, and art installations. I worked with rental companies, diverse tech riders, managed budgets, led teams for installation and live event tech, etc. <br><br>
				For the past decade, I have had a strong professional art career in the field of new media. I have presented work internationally in the context of interactive installations, live streaming, networked playback, live video design, VJâ€™ing, and performance. <br><br>
