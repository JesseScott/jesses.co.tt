				Jesse Scott creates and exhibits work in the genre formerly known as new media. <br/>
				<br/> <br/>
				I am: <br/> an artist + creative coder,<br/> designer + visualist,<br/> curator + producer,<br/> writer + educator.
				<br/> <br/>
				Under various aliases and operating within several artist collectives, I produce work for live performance, for site-specific actions, for listening, for viewing, for readingâ€¦
				<br/> <br/>
				My work has spanned the domains of a/v performance, locative media, telematics, improvisational practice, urban projection, installation design, public workshops, and the written word.
				<br/> <br/>
				Alongside <a href="http://fictionalanatomy.tumblr.com/">Mirae Rosner</a>,
				I run <a href="http://www.memelab.ca/">the memelab</a>,
				have co-founded both the <a href="http://graffitiresearchlab.ca/">Canadian</a> and <a href="http://graffitiresearchlab.de/">German</a> chapters of <a href="http://graffitiresearchlab.com/">Graffiti Research Lab</a>,
				and the <a href="http://processingvancouver.ca/">Vancouver</a> and <a href="http://www.onformative.com/processingberlin/">Berlin</a> chapters of <a href="http://www.processingcities.org/">Processing Cities</a>.
				<br/> <br/>
				Formerly, I was a member of The Butchershop, a non-denominational art space, NTSC, an audio-visual collective, and was President of Balcone Art Society.
				<br/> <br/>
				I have curated for the memelab, New Forms Festival, Balcone Art Society, Mobile Muse, The Butchershop, Nuclei of Telematic Sound and Cinematics, The Upgrade!, SWARM, and Gallery Gachet.
