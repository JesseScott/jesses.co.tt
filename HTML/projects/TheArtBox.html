			The Art Box

			<p> <a href=""></a>
				The Art Box was a public art commission from the <a href="http://www.cnv.org">City of North Vancouver</a> for their annual
				<br>
				<a href="http://www.cnv.org/studio">Studio In The City</a> program. I was approached and asked to direct a digital art project
				<br>
				in tandem with the instructors from the <a href="http://www.dmacademy.ca/">Digital Media Academy</a> at Argyle Secondary.
				<br>		
				<br>
				I led and worked with 12 high school students to identify a design problem for the site-specific install location
				<br>
				at Lonsdale Quay, and we collectively decided to design an outdoor interactive video gallery showcasing youth artwork.
				<br>
				<br>
				In the end, we built a three-channel sequenced video installation controlled by a 3D imaging camera, that unmasked the 
				<br>
				artwork underneath the silhouette of the user as they moved their bodies in front of the screens.
				<br>
				<br>
				The homepage for the project can be seen at <a href="http://www.theartbox.ca/">www.theartbox.ca</a> and the source code for the project is available on my 
				<a href="https://github.com/JesseScott/TheArtBox">GitHub</a>.
