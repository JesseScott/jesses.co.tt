			SonicDrift
		</H2>
		
		<H3>
			<p>SonicDrift is an Android smartphone application that detects GPS and allow users to record and playback sounds from their environment.</p>
			<p>It was built in <a href="http://processing.org/" target="_blank">Processing</a>, especially for Android OS, and once downloaded and installed, operates offline. This means that it can be used in virtually any location on the GPS grid. &nbsp;Recorded sounds are attached to a particular GPS point, stored within the app, and played back whenever a user passes through the point again. &nbsp;</p>
			<p>We have begun to apply SonicDrift to different contexts, creating sound walks with functions such as audio tours and experiental walks. &nbsp;The app can be used&nbsp;to record anecdotes, stories, environmental sounds, and other field recordings. Each particular landscape generates a different set of sounds, pathways, and relationship to scale.</p>
			<p>SonicDrift has been developed as part of the Nordic &amp; Baltic Sea Residency&nbsp;<a href="http://www.marin.cc/" target="_blank">M.A.R.I.N. 2011</a>: Cartography and the Everyday at Sea. &nbsp;</p>
